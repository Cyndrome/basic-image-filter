# Basic Image Filter
A very basic multifunctional program that can apply a few built-in filters to an image, also allowing the user to apply a custom filter. I created this for practice with image manipulation in Python. 

# Methodology
I've used the SimpleImage library to code this one. This library was built by Nick Parlante using Pillow, a version of the PIL. 

# Disclaimer
This is my first repository on Github and I'm still learning the basics of Python, so:
1. This program may have bugs. If you find any, please create an issue. 
2. I might have made silly mistakes regarding GitHub logistics.
